How to make a script executable as taken from StackOverflow:

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15587877/run-a-python-script-in-terminal-without-the-python-command

ou use a shebang line at the start of your script:

#!/usr/local/bin/env python2   (Change this because of suggestions in other SO post)
make the file executable:

chmod +x arbitraryname
and put it in a directory on your PATH (can be a symlink):

cd /usr/bin/
ln -s ~/some/path/to/myscript/arbitraryname
